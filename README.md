# Pneumonia Detection using Chest X-rays

This project uses deep learning algorithms and Keras library to determine if a person has pneumonia or not from their chest x-rays. The trained model is displayed using Streamlit, which enables the user to upload an image and receive instant feedback.



## Requirements

The following libraries are required for running this project:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pillow
- Streamlit


## Installation

If you have the requirements already installed, you can skip this section. If not, follow the steps below to install them:

1. Install TensorFlow:

    ```
    pip install tensorflow
    ```

2. Install Keras:

    ```
    pip install keras
    ```

3. Install Pillow:

    ```
    pip install pillow
    ```

4. Install Streamlit:

    ```
    pip install streamlit
    ```


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/SiddharthRajpal/Pneumonia-Recognition-With-Python.git
    cd Pneumonia-Recognition-With-Python
    ```

2. Run the Streamlit app:

    ```
    python3 -m streamlit run main.py
    ```
    or 
    ```
    python -m streamlit run main.py
    ```
    or
      ```
    py -m streamlit run main.py
    ```
    

3. Upload a chest x-ray image to see if a person has pneumonia or not.
